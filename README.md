# Introduction
This repository contain my personal config files on new age. Previously i had the same dotfiles repository but it was an old deprecated file and currently using the new configuration.

Be aware, products may change over time and i do my best to keep up with changes and the latest releases when i have enough free time, but please understand that this is not always the case.

I need to explain about "aliases" as a shortcut in a command, you may not be able to follow but this configuration will have tools that can make things easier on any distro or operating system. I hope so.

Currently i don't have any MAC OS device as test command, maybe i need some help on MAC user.
